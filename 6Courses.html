    <h2>1.Web Development</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Web Development: </b></dt>
        <dd>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves both front-end development, which focuses on the user interface using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development, which manages databases, servers, and application logic using languages like Node.js, Python, or PHP. Full-stack developers handle both ends, ensuring a complete and functional user experience. Web development plays a key role in creating responsive, interactive, and dynamic websites used in businesses, education, entertainment, and more.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>2. Java</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Java: </b></dt>
        <dd>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for building robust, secure, and platform-independent applications. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), Java follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere," meaning compiled Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is used in various domains such as web development, mobile apps (especially Android), enterprise software, desktop applications, and more. Javas features like strong memory management, multithreading, rich API, and automatic garbage collection make it a reliable choice for developers around the world.</dd>
    </dl>
        <h2>3. Python programming</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Python: </b></dt>
        <dd>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, Python has a clean syntax that makes it easy to learn, especially for beginners. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, artificial intelligence, scripting, and more. With its large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, Python enables developers to build powerful applications quickly and efficiently.</dd>

    <h2>4. Cyber Security</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Cyber Security: </b></dt>
        <dd>Cyber Security is the practice of protecting computers, networks, software, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. It involves implementing technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard digital systems from threats such as malware, phishing, ransomware, and hacking. Cyber security is crucial for maintaining privacy, securing financial and personal information, and ensuring the integrity of digital infrastructure. It includes various domains like network security, application security, cloud security, ethical hacking, cryptography, and incident response. With the increasing use of technology and the internet, cyber security has become an essential part of personal, organizational, and national safety.</dd>

    <h2>5. Data Structures & Algorithms</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Data Structures & Algorithms: </b></dt>
        <dd>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of efficient programming and problem-solving in computer science. A data structure is a way to organize and store data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently—for example, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to perform tasks like searching, sorting, or traversing data. Mastering DSA helps in writing optimized code, improving performance, and solving complex problems effectively. It is especially important for technical interviews, competitive programming, and building high-performance applications.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>6. Cloud Computing</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Cloud Computing: </b></dt>
        <dd>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet ("the cloud") instead of using local servers or personal devices. It allows individuals and organizations to access and manage resources on-demand without investing in physical infrastructure. Cloud computing offers flexibility, scalability, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Common service models include IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service). Popular cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud power many of today’s websites, apps, and business operations.</dd>
